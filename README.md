# kbox

kbox boots a real Linux kernel as an in-process library ([LKL](https://github.com/lkl/linux)) and routes intercepted syscalls to it via [`seccomp_unotify`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html). It provides a rootless chroot/proot alternative with kernel-level syscall accuracy.

## Why kbox

Running Linux userspace programs in a rootless, unprivileged environment requires intercepting their syscalls and providing a convincing kernel interface. Existing tools fall short:

- `chroot` requires root privileges (or user namespaces, which are unavailable on many systems including Termux and locked-down shared hosts).
- `proot` uses ptrace for syscall interception. ptrace is slow (two context switches per syscall), cannot faithfully emulate all syscalls, breaks under complex multi-threaded workloads, and its path translation is vulnerable to TOCTOU races.
- User Mode Linux (UML) runs as a separate supervisor/guest process tree with ptrace-based syscall routing, imposing overhead and complexity that LKL avoids by running in-process.
- `gVisor` implements a userspace kernel from scratch -- millions of lines reimplementing Linux semantics, inevitably diverging from the real kernel on edge cases.

kbox takes a fundamentally different approach: boot the actual Linux kernel as an in-process library and route intercepted syscalls to it. The kernel that handles your `open()` is the same kernel that runs on servers in production. No reimplementation, no approximation.

The interception mechanism matters too. seccomp-unotify delivers syscall notifications to a supervisor without requiring ptrace attachment or parent-child tracing relationships. The supervisor is just another process with a file descriptor. The tracee's syscall blocks in the kernel until the supervisor responds -- no TOCTOU window, no signal races, no thread-group confusion.

The result: programs get real VFS, real ext4, real procfs -- without root privileges, containers, VMs, or ptrace.

## How it works

```

1. The supervisor opens a rootfs disk image and registers it as an LKL block device.
2. LKL boots a real Linux kernel inside the process (no VM, no separate process tree).
3. The filesystem is mounted via LKL, and the supervisor sets the guest's virtual root via LKL's internal `chroot`.
4. A child process is forked with a seccomp BPF filter that delivers all syscalls (except a minimal allow-list: `sendmsg`, `exit`, `exit_group`) as user notifications.
5. The supervisor receives each notification via `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV`, translates paths and file descriptors, and forwards the syscall to either LKL or the host kernel.
6. Results are injected back via `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND`. For FD-returning syscalls (open, pipe, dup), `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD` injects file descriptors directly into the tracee's FD table.

### Syscall routing

Every intercepted syscall is dispatched to one of three dispositions:

- **LKL forward** (~74 handlers): filesystem operations (open, read, write, stat, getdents, mkdir, unlink, rename), metadata (chmod, chown, utimensat), identity (getuid, setuid, getgroups), and networking (socket, connect). The supervisor reads arguments from tracee memory via `process_vm_readv`, calls into LKL, and writes results back via `process_vm_writev`.
- **Host CONTINUE** (~34 entries): scheduling (sched_yield, sched_setscheduler), signals (rt_sigaction, kill, tgkill), memory management (mmap, mprotect, brk), I/O multiplexing (epoll, poll, select), threading (futex, clone, set_tid_address), and time (nanosleep, clock_gettime). These work correctly with the host kernel and incur no supervisor overhead.
- **Emulated**: process identity (getpid returns 1, gettid returns 1), uname (synthetic LKL values), getrandom (LKL `/dev/urandom`), clock_gettime/gettimeofday (host clock, direct passthrough for latency).

Unknown syscalls receive `ENOSYS`. ~50 dangerous syscalls (mount, reboot, init_module, bpf, ptrace, etc.) are rejected with `EPERM` directly in the BPF filter before reaching the supervisor.

### Key subsystems

**Virtual FD table** (`fd_table.c`): maintains a mapping from guest FD numbers to LKL-internal FDs. Two ranges: low FDs (0..1023) populated only by dup2/dup3 for shell I/O redirection, high FDs (32768+) for normal allocation. This split avoids collisions between host-kernel FDs (pipes, inherited descriptors) and LKL-managed FDs.

**Shadow FDs** (`shadow_fd.c`): when the guest opens a regular file O_RDONLY, the supervisor copies its contents from LKL into a host-visible memfd. The tracee receives the memfd number, enabling native mmap without LKL involvement. This is essential for dynamic linking: the ELF loader maps `.text` and `.rodata` segments via mmap, which requires a real host FD. Shadow FDs are point-in-time snapshots (no write-back), capped at 256MB.

**Path translation** (`path.c`): lexical normalization with 6 escape-prevention checks. Paths starting with `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev` are routed to the host kernel via CONTINUE. Everything else goes through LKL. The normalizer handles `..` traversal, double slashes, and symlink-based escape attempts (`/proc/self/root`, `/proc/<pid>/cwd`).

**ELF extraction** (`elf.c`, `image.c`): binaries are extracted from the LKL filesystem into memfds for `fexecve`. For dynamically-linked binaries, the PT_INTERP segment names an interpreter (e.g., `/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`) that does not exist on the host. The supervisor extracts the interpreter into a second memfd and patches PT_INTERP in the main binary to `/proc/self/fd/N`. The host kernel resolves this during `load_elf_binary`, before close-on-exec runs.

**Pipe architecture**: `pipe()`/`pipe2()` create real host pipes injected into the tracee via `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD`. No LKL involvement -- the host kernel manages fork inheritance and close semantics natively. This is why shell pipelines work: both parent and child share real pipe FDs that the host kernel handles.

### ABI translation

LKL is built as `ARCH=lkl`, which uses asm-generic headers. On x86_64, `struct stat` differs between asm-generic (128 bytes, `st_mode` at offset 16) and the native layout (144 bytes, `st_mode` at offset 24). Reading `st_mode` from an LKL-filled buffer using a host `struct stat` reads `st_uid` instead. kbox uses `struct kbox_lkl_stat` matching the asm-generic layout, with field-by-field conversion via `kbox_lkl_stat_to_host()` before writing to tracee memory. Compile-time `_Static_assert` checks enforce struct sizes and critical field offsets.

seccomp `args[]` zero-extends 32-bit values: fd=-1 becomes `0x00000000FFFFFFFF`, not `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`. All handlers extracting signed arguments (AT_FDCWD, MAP_ANONYMOUS fd) truncate to 32 bits before sign-extending: `(long)(int)(uint32_t)args[N]`.

On aarch64, four `O_*` flags differ between the host and asm-generic: `O_DIRECTORY`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_DIRECT`, `O_LARGEFILE`. The dispatch layer translates these bidirectionally.

## Building

Linux only (host kernel 5.0+ for seccomp-unotify). Requires GCC, GNU Make, and a pre-built `liblkl.a`. No `libseccomp` dependency -- the BPF filter is compiled natively.

```bash
make                        # debug build (ASAN + UBSAN enabled)
make BUILD=release          # release build
make KBOX_HAS_WEB=1         # enable web-based kernel observatory
```

LKL is fetched automatically from the [nightly pre-release](https://github.com/sysprog21/kbox/releases/tag/lkl-nightly) on first build. Pre-built binaries are available for both x86_64 and aarch64. To use a custom LKL:

```bash
make LKL_DIR=/path/to/lkl   # point to a directory with liblkl.a + lkl.h
make FORCE_LKL_BUILD=1      # force a from-source LKL rebuild
```

## Quick start

Build a test rootfs image (requires `e2fsprogs`, no root needed). The script auto-detects the host architecture and downloads the matching Alpine minirootfs:

```bash
make rootfs                 # creates alpine.ext4
```

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive shell with recommended mounts + root identity (recommended)
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 -- /bin/sh -i

# Run a specific command
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 -- /bin/ls -la /

# Recommended mounts without root identity
./kbox image -R alpine.ext4 -- /bin/sh -i

# Raw mount only (no /proc, /sys, /dev -- for targeted commands)
./kbox image -r alpine.ext4 -- /bin/cat /etc/os-release

# Minimal mount profile (proc + tmpfs only)
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 --mount-profile minimal -- /bin/sh -i

# Custom kernel cmdline, bind mount, explicit identity
./kbox image -r alpine.ext4 -k "mem=2048M loglevel=7" \
    -b /home/user/data:/mnt/data --change-id 1000:1000 -- /bin/sh -i
```

Note: use `/bin/sh -i` for interactive sessions. The `-i` flag forces the shell into interactive mode regardless of terminal detection.

Run `./kbox image --help` for the full option list.

## Web-based kernel observatory

The kernel runs in the same address space as the supervisor. Every data structure -- scheduler runqueues, page cache state, VFS dentries, slab allocator metadata -- is directly readable. kbox exploits this by sampling LKL's internal `/proc` files and streaming the data to a browser dashboard.

This is not strace. strace shows syscall arguments and return values from the outside. The web observatory shows what happens inside the kernel while processing those syscalls: context switches accumulating, page cache warming, memory allocators splitting buddy pages, softirqs firing.

Traditional kernel observation requires root (ftrace, perf), serial connections (KGDB), or kernel recompilation (printk). LKL eliminates all of these barriers. The supervisor calls `kbox_lkl_openat("/proc/stat")` and reads LKL's own procfs -- not the host's -- from an unprivileged process.

```bash
# Build with web support
make KBOX_HAS_WEB=1 BUILD=release

# Launch with observatory on default port 8080
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 --web -- /bin/sh -i

# Custom port and bind address (e.g., access from outside a VM)
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 --web=9090 --web-bind 0.0.0.0 -- /bin/sh -i

# JSON trace to stderr without HTTP server
./kbox image -S alpine.ext4 --trace-format json -- /bin/ls /
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in a browser. The dashboard shows:

- **Syscall activity**: stacked time-series of dispatch rate by family (file I/O, directory, FD ops, identity, memory, signals, scheduler). Computed as deltas between 3-second polling intervals.
- **Memory**: stacked area chart of LKL kernel memory breakdown (free, buffers, cached, slab, used) read from `/proc/meminfo`.
- **Scheduler**: context switch rate from `/proc/stat` and load average from `/proc/loadavg`.
- **Interrupts**: per-type softirq distribution (TIMER, NET_RX, NET_TX, BLOCK, SCHED, etc.) from `/proc/softirqs`.
- **Event feed**: scrolling SSE stream of individual syscall dispatches with per-call latency, color-coded by disposition, filterable, click-to-expand.
- **System gauges**: SVG arc gauges for syscalls/s, context switches/s, memory pressure, FD table occupancy.

API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Dashboard SPA (compiled-in HTML/JS/CSS via `xxd -i`) |
| `/api/snapshot` | GET | Current telemetry snapshot (JSON) |
| `/api/events` | GET | SSE stream of dispatch events |
| `/api/history` | GET | Historical snapshots for chart backfill |
| `/api/enosys` | GET | Per-syscall-number ENOSYS hit counts |
| `/stats` | GET | Quick health summary |
| `/api/control` | POST | Pause/resume telemetry sampling |

Implementation details:

- The telemetry sampler runs on the main dispatch thread's poll timeout (100ms tick), reading LKL `/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/vmstat`, `/proc/loadavg` via `kbox_lkl_openat`/`kbox_lkl_read`. A 5ms per-tick time budget prevents expensive `/proc` parsing from starving seccomp dispatch.
- The HTTP server runs in a dedicated pthread with its own epoll set. Shared state (snapshots, event ring) is protected by a single mutex. Counter fields use `atomic_int` for cross-thread flags.
- The event ring buffer holds 1024 entries split into 768 for sampled routine events (1% probabilistic sampling for high-frequency syscalls like read/write) and 256 reserved for errors and rare events (execve, clone, exit -- always captured). Events are sequence-numbered to prevent SSE duplicate delivery.
- Dispatch instrumentation adds ~25ns overhead per intercepted syscall (one `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` call before and after dispatch).
- All frontend assets (Chart.js 4.4.7, vanilla JS, CSS) are compiled into the binary via `xxd -i` at build time. No CDN, no npm, no runtime file I/O. The entire dashboard is self-contained in the kbox binary.
- When `--web` is not passed, the web subsystem is completely inert -- no threads, no sockets, no overhead. When `KBOX_HAS_WEB` is not set at build time, the web code compiles to empty translation units.

## Testing

```bash
make check                  # all tests (unit + integration + stress)
make check-unit             # unit tests under ASAN/UBSAN
make check-integration      # integration tests against a rootfs image
make check-stress           # stress test programs
```

Unit tests (82 tests) have no LKL dependency and run on any Linux host. Integration tests (43 tests) run guest binaries inside kbox against an Alpine ext4 image. Stress tests exercise fork storms, FD exhaustion, concurrent I/O, signal races, and long-running processes.

All tests run clean under ASAN and UBSAN. Guest binaries are compiled without sanitizers (shadow memory interferes with `process_vm_readv`).

## GDB integration

Because LKL runs in-process, the entire kernel lives in the same address space as the supervisor. Students can set GDB breakpoints on kernel functions, read live procfs data, and trace syscall paths end-to-end -- from seccomp notification through VFS traversal down to the ext4 block layer.

```bash
# Load kbox and LKL GDB helpers
source scripts/gdb/kbox-gdb.py

# Break when a specific syscall enters dispatch
kbox-break-syscall openat

# Print the virtual FD table (LKL FD -> host FD mapping)
kbox-fdtable

# Trace path translation: lexical normalization + virtual/host routing
kbox-vfs-path /proc/../etc/passwd

# Walk LKL task list (kernel threads, idle task)
kbox-task-walk

# Inspect LKL memory state (buddy allocator, slab caches)
kbox-mem-check

# Coordinated breakpoints across seccomp dispatch and LKL kernel entry
kbox-syscall-trace
```

The GDB helpers and the web observatory read the same kernel state through different mechanisms. GDB helpers use DWARF debug info to resolve struct offsets at runtime (`gdb.parse_and_eval`). The web telemetry reads `/proc` files via `kbox_lkl_read`, which is stable across kernel versions and requires no debug info. They are complementary: the web UI shows what is happening at a high level; GDB shows why at the instruction level.

See `docs/gdb-workflow.md` for the full workflow.
